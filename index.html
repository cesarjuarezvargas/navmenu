            <h2>Dare to reinvent yourself!</h2>
            <p>Hello Tony! This is the nav_menus project. This time, I chose to experiment with gradients within the wrapper and the navigation buttons. Hope you like it!</p>
            <p>I realized that as soon as you add another line on the navigation buttons on top, the float arragement is broken. How can the float be locked while keeping the original font size? </p>
            <p>Also, if I add an effect of the font size diminishing on the horizontal nav menu, the float breaks and drags all the vertical menu all the way to the right while pushing down the paragraphs. Do we need to lock the vertical menu, the wrapper or the horizontal menu?</p>
            <p>As they are, the navigation menus appear to be quite large in fonts, which is something that clients may not like. I have visited many sites on which I wish they'd featured a font-size increase menu instead of I having to use the browser zoom in/out options. For the sake of accessibility elements, would incorporating a user-friendly increase/decrease font size menu be feasible on CSS or JS? My take is that since that'd be a user operated tool, the best bet would be JavaScript. Any input on that one? </p>
            <p>I've doing some research, but can't seem to find the CSS instruction to prevent the horizonal nav menu to overlap when the user shrinks the browser window. I tried position values, but with no result or a complete overlap of the options on the left. Is it because of the floating action that is going on? </p>
            <p>Lastly, I would love to work all our projects to make them evolve as part of my student portfolio. Do you recommend leaving them as they are to show how my skills changed over the course of the program or perhaps tailoring them to follow cool trendy sites? </p>
            <p>Thanks for visiting!  </p>
